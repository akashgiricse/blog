# Microservices Key points
## Book : Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems by Sam Newman
### Chapter 1
 *  Microservices should be small and focused on doing one thing well
 *  “Gather together those things that change for the
same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.”
 *  Microservices should be **Autonomous**. APIs should be good and decoupled.
 *  Key Benefits:
	* **Technology Heterogeneity** : User technology of your choice.
	* **Resilience**: If one component of a system fails, but that failure doesn't cascade, you can isolate the problem and the rest of the system can carry on working
	* **Scaling**
	* **Ease of deployment**
	* **Organizational Alignment**: Small team with small codebase is more productive than large teams with large codebase. 
	* **Composability**: Reuse of functionality.
	* **Optimizing for Replaceability**
	
### Chapter 2
 * The evolutionary vision for the Architech
