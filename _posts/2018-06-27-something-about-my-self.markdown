Hello, I'm Akash Giri, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bundelkhand Institute of Engineering and Technology, Jhansi, India.

My journey to computer science began after I joined my college. I have been interested in web development ever since I created my first blog web app using python's web framework Django. After that, I have worked on various web app projects. Currently, I'm learning the technologies which are required to become a full stack developer. Most of the technologies I have learned are self-taught.


``Always looking forward to work in a challenging environment to deliver my best and strive to learn and improve constantly.``

My area of interest is Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, and Physics. Talking about my hobbies, I love pencil sketching. I'm a sketch artist since my childhood. I also love reading online articles about modern technologies, motivation, biography, etc. I am a food lover.

Written with :heart: by me.
